# Release 4: JSON specification composition and readable spec summaries

This is a planned release grouping, not a published software version.
These packages can ship independently of new execution capabilities.

## Work package: Specification summary

**Prerequisites:** Existing specification model.

| title | breaking | description |
|---|---|---|
| Print a concise spec summary | No | Add a public `Spec.print_summary()` method that prints a readable overview of a specification, and demonstrate it in the project README's Python example. |

## Work package: Specification composition

**Prerequisites:** Existing specification loading and semantic validation.
Keep merge rules independent of later execution capabilities.

| title | breaking | description |
|---|---|---|
| Merge JSON specification files | No | Read multiple JSON files and recursively merge objects before existing model and semantic validation. Accept identical overlaps; report conflicts with files and JSON paths. Arrays are whole values, not concatenated or deduplicated. Set the combined spec's name and source explicitly rather than merging contributor metadata. Fragments need not be semantically valid alone. Reuse reference, contract, producer and cycle checks. Do not add repository fetching, package discovery, version resolution, automatic namespacing or identifier rewriting. |
